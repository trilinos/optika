\section Optika_intro Introduction 
The Optika package is intended to give Trilinos Developers an 
easy way to construct a GUI for their program. Through the use of Teuchos ParameterLists,
the Optika package will allow the developer to achieve the following
workflow within their program:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Specify a list of inputs needed from the user
	\item Define valid values for inputs as well as defaults
	\item Present the required inputs to the user in the form of a GUI
	\item Allow the user to change the values of the inputs to their liking
	\item Obtain the values the user entered in the form of a Parameter List.
	\end{enumerate}

\section Compile Notes
In order to compile Optika you must have Qt installed. You can either download Qt directly from the website (http://www.qtsoftware.com) or if you are on Linux, you can use your package manager.
If you use your package manager, may sure you download the Qt developement package (usually something like qt4-devel) and that it is Qt version 4.5 or higher. If you download Qt directly and put it some where other than the default
installation directory you will have to compile trilinos using these cmake arguments:
	<ul>
	<li> -DQT\_INCLUDE\_DIRS:STRING=directory containing your qt include files</li>
	<li> -DQT\_LIBRARY\_DIRS:STRING=directory containing your qt libraries</li>
	<li> -DQT\_BINARY\_DIR:STRING=directory containing your qt binaries</li>
	</ul>


You can browse all of Optika as a <A HREF="../../browser/doc/html/index.html">single
doxygen collection</A>. Warning, this is not the recommended way to learn
about Optika software.  However, this is a good way to browse the <a
href="../../browser/doc/html/dirs.html">directory structure of optika</a>, to <a
href="../../browser/doc/html/files.html">locate files</a>, etc.
