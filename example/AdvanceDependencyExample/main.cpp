  //Hoookay. So the goal of this first part is to setup the following parameters:
  // -Nsurf_types The number of surface types
  // -Ndim The number of dimensions
  // -Surf_Type An array specifying the type of surface for every surface type we have
  //
  // We're gonna need the following dependencies:
  // -The lengths of the array in Surf_Type is dependent upon how many surfaces we have
  // -The valid types of surfaces are dependent upon how many dimensions we have
  //
  // Let's get started!


  //Here we'll make the validator for the Nsurf_types parameter.
  //Teuchos::rcp is a short cut. We bascially don't have to template the RCP constructor now. It just knows what to template based on the argument it's given.
  //Normally the this line would read:
  //Teuchos::RCP<Optika::EnhancedNumberValidator<int> > nSurfTypesValidator  = Teuchos::RCP<Optika::EnhancedNumberValidator<int> >(new Optika::EnhancedNumberValidator<int>());
  //but by using the namespace stuff I should you above, and the rcp function, we can write it concisely like this:
  RCP<EnhancedNumberValidator<int> > nSurfTypesValidator  = rcp(new EnhancedNumberValidator<int>());

  //Let's say in this case you only want to set a minimum on the validator. We used the empty constructor above (which means no mins or maxs have been set), so we cna just set the min right now.
  nSurfTypesValidator->setMin(0);
  surfDefParams->set("Nsurf_types", 1, "The number of different surface types you have", nSurfTypesValidator);

  //Just setting the min and max now for the nDim Validator
  RCP<EnhancedNumberValidator<int> > nDimVali = rcp(new EnhancedNumberValidator<int>(1,3));
  surfDefParams->set("Ndim", 1, "Number of dimensions", nDimVali);

  //Now for the fun part. We're gonna set up the array. We want to use three different validators, so this array needs to implement: a validatord if Ndim=1, a validator if ndim=2, and a validator for when ndim=3.
  //Lets's start by making those three validators
  RCP<StringValidator> surfTypeVali1 = rcp<StringValidator>(new StringValidator(tuple<std::string>("Infinite Planar Wall", "Finite Planar Wall")));
  RCP<StringValidator> surfTypeVali2 = rcp<StringValidator>(new StringValidator(tuple<std::string>("Infinite Planar Wall", "Finite Planar Wall", "Colloids", "Pore", "Finite Pore", "Tapered Pore")));
  RCP<StringValidator> surfTypeVali3 = rcp<StringValidator>(new StringValidator(tuple<std::string>("Infinite Planar Wall", "Finite Planar Wall", "Colloids", "Atoms", "Point Atoms", "Finite Length Cylinder", 
  "Cylinder with Periodic function for the radius", "Pore", "Finite Pore", "Tapered Pore")));

  //Since we're gonna use them on an array we need to wrap an ArrayStringValidator around each of them. 
  //We could've done this in one step, but I think it looks cleaner this way, plus if you ever wanna use just these regular validators again, you can do that.
  RCP<ArrayStringValidator> arraySurfTypeVali1 = rcp(new ArrayStringValidator(surfTypeVali1));
  RCP<ArrayStringValidator> arraySurfTypeVali2 = rcp(new ArrayStringValidator(surfTypeVali2));
  RCP<ArrayStringValidator> arraySurfTypeVali3 = rcp(new ArrayStringValidator(surfTypeVali3));

  //setup the array in accordance with 1-d and 1 surfaces (the defaults we setup above). By doing it this way, 
  //if we ever change the default Value for Nsurf_types, we won't have to change it again down here. This is good because it'll also prevent errors (for instance when we
  //change the value above but now down here)
  Array<std::string> surfTypeArray(Teuchos::getValue<int>(surfDefParams->getEntry("Nsurf_types")), "Infinite Planar Wall");

  //same thing here. If we ever change Ndim, won't have to make any changes down here
  switch(Teuchos::getValue<int>(surfDefParams->getEntry("Ndim"))){
	case 1:
  		surfDefParams->set("Surf_Type", surfTypeArray, "Array of surface types", arraySurfTypeVali1);
		break;
	case 2:
  		surfDefParams->set("Surf_Type", surfTypeArray, "Array of surface types", arraySurfTypeVali2);
		break;
	case 3:
  		surfDefParams->set("Surf_Type", surfTypeArray, "Array of surface types", arraySurfTypeVali3);
		break;
	default:
  		surfDefParams->set("Surf_Type", surfTypeArray, "Array of surface types", arraySurfTypeVali1);
		break;
	}

	//Ok, so now for the really really fun part. setting up the dependencies. Let's do the ArrayLengthDependency first.
	RCP<NumberArrayLengthDependency<int, std::string> > surfTypeLengthDep = rcp(
		new NumberArrayLengthDependency<int, std::string>(
			surfDefParams->getEntryRCP("Nsurf_types"),
			surfDefParams->getEntryRCP("Surf_Type")
		)
	);
  
  //Now for one of the trickier dependencies, RangeValidatorDependency. First we make a map of ranges to validators. 
  //It's kind of overkill for our situation here because our ranges are small (size 1). But you get the idea, these ranges could be arbitrary in size.
  RangeValidatorDependency<int>::RangeToValidatorMap dimranges;
  dimranges[std::pair<int,int>(1,1)] = arraySurfTypeVali1;
  dimranges[std::pair<int,int>(2,2)] = arraySurfTypeVali2;
  dimranges[std::pair<int,int>(3,3)] = arraySurfTypeVali3;
	
  //Here we actually make the dependency. Take a look at the documentation for an explainiation of each argument
  RCP<RangeValidatorDependency<int> > 
	surfTypeValiDep = rcp(
		new RangeValidatorDependency<int>(
			surfDefParams->getEntryRCP("Ndim"),
			surfDefParams->getEntryRCP("Surf_Type"),
			dimranges
		)
	);

  //add dependencies
  depSheet1->addDependency(surfTypeLengthDep);
  depSheet1->addDependency(surfTypeValiDep);

  //BOOM! You're good to go. What all this will do is:
  //	-Use different validators on the array based on how many dimensions the user has selected
  //	-Adjust the length of the array based on how many surface types the user has specified.

  /*
   * Let's pause for a moment. Give yourself a pat on the back. You've made it really far in these examples!
   * So I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. Up until this point, all the dependencies you've seen have 
   * had only one dependee and one dependent, but the truth is all dependencies can actually have multiple 
   * dependents. And, if you use the super special ConditionVisualDependency, you can actually have multiple 
   * dependees! Holy Cow! I know right? Just blew you mind didn't I? Let's take a look and see how this all
   * works.
   */

  //Alright lets start off by creating a new parameter list with some more parameters.
  RCP<ParameterList> crazyDepList = sublist(Tramonto_List, "CRAZY AWESOME DEPENDENCY STUFF...list"); 

  //A number validator
  RCP<EnhancedNumberValidator<int> > scaleValidator = rcp(new EnhancedNumberValidator<int>(1,10));

  // a few parameters
  crazyDepList->set("Are you at all cool?", true, "Hey, it's a valid question.");
  crazyDepList->set("Sweetness", 7, "How sweet are you?", scaleValidator);
  crazyDepList->set("Awesomeness", 7, "How awesome are you?", scaleValidator);
  crazyDepList->set("Special parameter", "", "A parameter that only the coolest of the cool can see");


  //So first we'll tackle multiple dependents. Let's set up a BoolVisualDependency...WITH MULTIPLE DEPENDENTS!
  //First we make a list of all the dependents.
  Dependency::ParameterEntryList dependents;
  dependents.insert(crazyDepList->getEntryRCP("Sweetness"));
  dependents.insert(crazyDepList->getEntryRCP("Awesomeness"));

  //Now we only wanna show these parameters if the user is at least some what cool. So well make the actuall dependency now.
  RCP<BoolVisualDependency> boolDep = rcp(new BoolVisualDependency(crazyDepList->getEntryRCP("Are you at all cool?"), dependents, true));
  depSheet1->addDependency(boolDep);

  //There, now those two parameters will only show if the users is at least some what cool.

  //Alright, now that we've got that out off the way, it's time for the creme de la creme,
  //multiple dependees. This one was a doozy for me to implement and requires a little bit
  //of work for both of us.

  //There is only one type of dependency that allows for multiple dependees, the 
  //ConditionVisualDependency. The first thing we gotta do is make to make a condition.
  //This will actually take the place of our dependee. There are a few types of conditions.
  //The first and most basic condition is a ParameterCondition: it simply tests the
  //condition of a Parameter.

  //Here's a NumberCondition, which is a type of ParameterCondition. It simply checks to
  // see if the value of some number parameter is greater than 0. If greater than 0, 
  //the condition evaluates to true. Otherwise, it evaluates false.
  RCP<NumberCondition<int> > intCon1 = rcp(new NumberCondition<int>(crazyDepList->getEntryRCP("Sweetness"), intFunc));
  RCP<NumberCondition<int> > intCon2 = rcp(new NumberCondition<int>(crazyDepList->getEntryRCP("Awesomeness"), intFunc));

  //And here's a Bool Condition.
  RCP<BoolCondition> boolCon1 = rcp(new BoolCondition(crazyDepList->getEntryRCP("Are you at all cool?")));

  //You can then combine conditions using a BinaryLogicalCondition. A BinaryLogicCondition
  //takes multiple conditions and evaluates them together in some fashion.
  
  //This is an And condition (an and? that sounds weird). If all the conditions it's assigned are true, it evaluates
  //to true. Just like a logical AND would. First we have to put all our conditions in a list (note the const).
  Condition::ConstConditionList conList1 = tuple<RCP<const Condition> >(intCon1, intCon2, boolCon1);

  //And now we make the And Condition
  RCP<AndCondition> andCon1 = rcp(new AndCondition(conList1));
  
  //Now we're ready to make our ConditionVisualDependency.
  RCP<ConditionVisualDependency> conVis1 = rcp(new ConditionVisualDependency(andCon1, crazyDepList->getEntryRCP("Special parameter"), true));

  //There you have it. Now the Special parameter will only be shown if the Are you cool
  //at all parameter is true and both the Sweetness and Aweseomness parameters are set
  //to 10.
  depSheet1->addDependency(conVis1);

  //Now we run it and bask in all it's rediculous glory.
  getInput(Tramonto_List, depSheet1);
	
  return 0;
  /*
   * Alright, so a few final notes. 
   *  -All of the Parameter Conditions have a bool
   *   switch that allow you to say "evaluate to true if the condition is false".
   *  -In addition to the Bool and Number Parameter, there's also a String Parameter.
   *  -The other BinaryLogicConditions are Or and Equals.
   *  -There's also a NotCondition that negates the condition given to it.
   *  -You can chain together an arbitrary amount of Conditions. You could give an And condition
   *   a list of conditions that contained some Or coniditoins, which contained some Not conditions
   *   which contained some...we'll you get the idea.
   * That's it! You're now an Optika expert! I'm so proud of you :D Good job!
