   * Here we create a Dependency. There are several different types of dependencies but they all follow the 
   * same general outline: A dependent (which can be a parameter or parameter list) is dependent upon a 
   * dependee (which is always a non-array parameter). Different dependencies usually have different 
   * requirements of their dependee and dependent. So be sure to check a dependecies documentation if you're 
   * at all unsure whether or not you're using one correctly. Also, if you use a dependency incorrectly, 
   * you'll be notified by an error and the GUI will never execute. It's always important to make sure the 
   * GUI can at least run. Most errors that result from improperly formed dependencies will be caught before 
   * the user ever sees the GUI.
   *
   * Below is a bool visual dependency. What this means is the dependent's visibility to the user
   * is determined by the dependee's boolean value. Here the dependent is the ParameterList "Preconditioner".
   * The dependee is a boolean parameter called ShowPrec. We only want the Preconditioner ParameterList to show 
   * if the ShowPrecs parameter is set to true, so we give the boolean value of "true" as the showIf argument.
   * We also specify the parent parameter lists of both the dependent and the dependee.
   *
   * Note how both the Preconditioner sublist and ShowPrecs parameter are located in our "Root List" (which also
   * happens to be their parent ParameterList).
   *
   * If we were to write out this dependency as a sentance, it would read like this:
   * Only show the Preconditioner list if the ShowPrecs parameter is set to true.

  /*
   * Final notes:
   *
   * Remember: It's always a good idea to make sure you're GUI works. Basic issues will not allow the GUI
   * to be even displayed to the user. So if your GUI can simply launch, that means you can feel pretty good
   * about the dependencies working the way they should. Still, you should make sure they do what you think
   * their doing.
   *
   * Remember: Dependents and Dependees don't have to have the same parent list. They just have to be located
   * some where in the "Root List" (or one of its sublists) of the dependency sheet.
   *
   * Remember: When making dependencies you must use the exact names of the the parameter and/or parameter lists
   * when specifying the dependent and the dependee. If you mispell the names, and there is no parameter and/or
   * parameter list by the name in the Root List (or one of it's sublists), the GUI won't even start up. 
   * It'll just throw and error. Worse, if you mispelled a name and there is a parameter or parameter list by 
   * that name in the root list, then your GUI will probably behave erratically.
   *
   * Remmeber: Different depenencies have different requirements. Be sure to check the documentation of the
   * dependency you're using to make sure you're getting it right. Otherwise you (or worse, your users) might
   * have some nasty problems down the road. Most of the time, if you try to preform a dependency incorrectly
   * your program will compile but the GUI will throw an error before it ever opens.
   *
   * Remember: All depenencies are evaluted before the user can ever interact with the GUI. Make sure that your
   * dependee's default values will result in desireable behavior.
   *
   * Remember: Arrays can't be dependees. If you would like this functionality please contact the author
   * of this package (Kurtis Nusbaum: klnusbaum@gmail.com), because he's thinking about including it in 
   * a future release.
